# Benchmarking TruffleRuby

This document lists the most important points to consider when benchmarking TruffleRuby.

## Guidelines for Benchmarking TruffleRuby

We expect anyone publishing benchmark numbers about TruffleRuby to follow these guidelines.

### Use Oracle GraalVM

Use [Oracle GraalVM](installing-truffleruby.md#oracle-graalvm-and-graalvm-community-edition) (before 23.0: GraalVM Enterprise Edition), it is faster than GraalVM Community Edition overall and represents what TruffleRuby is capable of.

Use `ruby --version` to ensure that you are running Oracle GraalVM.

### Use the Latest Release

Always use the latest release at the time of benchmarking (so it does not misrepresent TruffleRuby by using an old release which may have known performance issues).

### Use the Correct Runtime Configuration

TruffleRuby has two Runtime Configurations, Native and JVM, see [this comparison](../../README.md#truffleruby-runtime-configurations).

If you want to benchmark peak performance, you should use the JVM configuration.
To do so, set the environment variable `TRUFFLERUBYOPT=--jvm` so it affects all TruffleRuby processes.
You can also pass `--jvm` as an argument to TruffleRuby if you are sure there are no subprocesses.

The Native configuration provides better startup and warmup but has slower peak performance.

Of course you can also benchmark both configurations and see which one is better for what you are benchmarking.

### Run with Enough Warmup

TruffleRuby like other runtimes with a just-in-time compiler needs some time (called warmup) to reach peak performance,
because it takes time to just-in-time compile the relevant methods of the benchmark.
The easiest way to check if there was enough warmup is to run the benchmark workload repeatedly inside a process and print the times of each run.
The times should be very stable once it's warmed up and conversely keep changing while it is not warmed up yet.
See [this documentation](reporting-performance-problems.md) for more details about warmup.

### Consider Disabling the Global C-Extension Lock

On TruffleRuby, C extensions by default use a global extension lock for maximum compatibility with CRuby.
Extensions marked as thread-safe by using `rb_ext_ractor_safe()` or `rb_ext_thread_safe()` do not use the global extension lock and run in parallel.

If you are benchmarking a multi-threaded Ruby program (e.g. Rails on a multi-threaded server),
and not all extensions are already marked as thread-safe, it is worth trying
`TRUFFLERUBYOPT="--experimental-options --cexts-lock=false"`.

## Recommendations

These are more general recommendations about benchmarking.

### Avoid Benchmarking on a Laptop

Performance on laptops is very sensitive to heat, and so overall quite unstable.
As an example, if the CPU gets too warm the operating system will throttle it, making the benchmark results unfair and unstable.
So benchmarking should be done on on a desktop computer or server.

### Avoid Other Running Processes

As those would cause extra noise in benchmarking results.
Definitely no browser, slack, IDE, etc as those use a lot of CPU.

### Disable Frequency Scaling

CPU frequency scaling and boost generally just increases noise in benchmarking results,
so it is recommended to disable them when benchmarking for more stable results.

For Intel CPUs use:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo'
```

For AMD CPUs use:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost'
```

Also make sure the performance governor is used on Linux:

```bash
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance
cpupower frequency-info
```

### Do not pin TruffleRuby to a Single Core

TruffleRuby uses multiple threads for the JIT Compiler, the GC, etc.
Restricting it to a single core for benchmarking does not make sense, it would cause a lot of contention.

### Avoid Benchmarking on macOS

macOS's memory management is subpar and can cause unnecessary memory swapping even when there is enough memory (e.g. it sometimes keeps terminated processes in memory needlessly).

macOS's TCP stack is also subpar, see the [Passenger docs](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/config/apache/optimization/#operating-system-recommendations) on this subject.

If you have no choice but to benchmark on macOS then mention that with the results
and ensure there is plenty free memory and no swap while benchmarking.
Use `vm_stat` (`Pages free`) or `top` (`PhysMem` -> `unused`) to check the amount of free memory.
Unfortunately neither of these tools show the swap usage, illustrating how difficult it is to ensure there is no swapping going on when benchmarking on macOS.
Use `Activity Monitor` before and after benchmarking to ensure there is no swap (`Swap Used`) as a workaround.
`Activity Monitor` is too heavy to be used during benchmarking.
