# Security

Please report security vulnerabilities via the process outlined in the [reporting vulnerabilities guide](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/reporting.html).
Specific guidelines for reporting security issues of the GraalVM project, including TruffleRuby, can be found in the [SECURITY file](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

## MRI Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities reported against MRI may apply to the design of Ruby or to code that we share with MRI.
We list reported MRI vulnerabilities here and document how MRI has mitigated the vulnerability, if the mitigation is tested
by anything, and how TruffleRuby has mitigated. We have not investigated all legacy vulnerabilities, as it is often very hard to work out the details from older reports.

Cross-reference with the details on [the MRI website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/security/).

## JRuby Vulnerabilities

TruffleRuby uses code from JRuby, so vulnerabilities reported against JRuby may apply to TruffleRuby.

Number | Description | Their Mitigation | Test | Our Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
CVE-2012-5370 | JRuby computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably (cross-reference CVE-2011-4815, CVE-2011-4838, CVE-2012-5372) | Hashes are made non-deterministic by incorporating process start time | Tested in `ruby/spec` `:security` | Hashes are made non-deterministic by incorporating a seed from `/dev/urandom`

## Rubinius Vulnerabilities

TruffleRuby uses code from Rubinius, so vulnerabilities reported against Rubinius may apply to TruffleRuby.

Number | Description | Their Mitigation | Test | Our Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
CVE-2012-5372 | Rubinius computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably (cross-reference CVE-2011-4815, CVE-2011-4838, CVE-2012-5370) | Hashes are made non-deterministic by incorporating output from `/dev/urandom` | Tested in `ruby/spec` `:security` | Hashes are made non-deterministic by incorporating a seed from `/dev/urandom`

## Java Dependency Vulnerabilities

### JONI

No vulnerabilities are known.

### JCodings

--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
CVE-2010-1330 | The regular expression engine in JRuby before 1.4.1, when `$KCODE` is set to `'u'`, does not properly handle characters immediately after a UTF-8 character | Check byte sequences for the UTF-8 encoding when perform regexp operations | Tested in `ruby/spec` `:security` | Applied the same mitigation

## Other Dependency Vulnerabilities

### `zlib`

No vulnerabilities are known, but consider potential vulnerabilities in your system `zlib`.

### `libssl`

Consider potential vulnerabilities in your system `libssl`.

### FFI

Number | Description | Their Mitigation | Test | Our Mitigation
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
CVE-2018-1000201 | A DLL loading issue can be hijacked on Windows when a `Symbol` is used for the library name | Treat Symbols the same as Strings in `ffi_lib` | | Applied the same mitigation, by using a version of FFI which fixed this vulnerability

## Notes on Hashing

TruffleRuby uses `MurmurHash2` hashing with a seed from `/dev/urandom` - it cannot be configured to use any other hashing algorithm.
For hashing strings, TruffleRuby uses Java's hash algorithm (and then `MurmurHash2` on top).
