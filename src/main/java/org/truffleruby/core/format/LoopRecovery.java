    /** Format strings can sometimes be dynamically generated with code such as:
     * <p>
     * <code>'x' + ('NX' * size)</code>
     * <p>
     * This is problematic for us as it expands to:
     * <p>
     * <code>xNXNXNXNXNXNXNXNXNXNX...</code>
     * <p>
     * We will struggle to compile that with a large value for size because it will generate a huge number of nodes.
     * Even if we could compile it, it's not great for memory consumption or the instruction cache. Instead, we'd like
     * to recover the loop in there and convert it to:
     * <p>
     * <code>x(NX)1000</code>
     * <p>
     * We could try and do something really sophisticated here, with nested loops and finding the optimal pattern, but
     * for the moment we just look for one simple loop.
     * <p>
     * To do that, for each character we look 1..n characters behind and see if that pattern is repeated. If it is we
     * have the loop. We then keep going and see how many more times we can loop. Nothing more complicated than that. */
