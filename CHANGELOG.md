* Calling blocking system calls and running C code with unblocking actions has been refactored to remove some optimisation boundaries.
* `return` expressions are now rewritten as implicit return expressions where control flow allows this to be safely done as a tail optimisation. This can improve interpreter performance by up to 50% in some benchmarks, and can be applied to approximately 80% of return nodes seen in Rails and its dependencies (#1977).
* The old array strategy code has been removed and all remaining nodes converted to the new `ArrayStoreLibrary`.
* Updated `nil` to be a global immutable singleton (#1835).

# 19.3.0

New features:

* Compilation of C extensions is now done with an internal LLVM toolchain producing both native code and bitcode. This means more C extensions should compile out of the box and this should resolve most linker-related issues.
* It is no longer necessary to install LLVM for installing C extensions on TruffleRuby.
* It is no longer necessary to install libc++ and libc++abi for installing C++ extensions on TruffleRuby.
* On macOS, it is no longer necessary to install the system headers package (#1417).
* License updated to EPL 2.0/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 like recent JRuby.

Bug fixes:

* `rb_undef_method` now works for private methods (#1731, @cky).

* Hash code calculation has been improved to reduce hash collisions for `Hash` and other cases.

Performance:

* `eval(code, binding)` for a fixed `code` containing blocks is now much faster. This improves the performance of rendering `ERB` templates containing loops.
* `rb_str_cat` is faster due to the C string now being concatenated without first being converted to a Ruby string or having its encoding checked. As a side effect the behaviour of `rb_str_cat` should now more closely match that of MRI.

* The `rb_tr_handle_*` functions have been removed as they are no longer used in any C extension patches.
* Underscores and dots in options have become hyphens, so `--exceptions.print_uncaught_java` is now `--exceptions-print-uncaught-java`, for example.
* The `rb_tr_handle_*` functions have been removed as they are no longer used in any C extension patches.

Bug fixes:

* `ripper` is still not implemented, but the module now exists and has some methods that are implemented as no-ops.

# 1.0 RC 13, 5 March 2019

Note that as TruffleRuby RC 13 is built on Ruby 2.4.4 it is still vulnerable to CVE-2018-16395. This will be fixed in the next release.

* `TracePoint.trace` and `TracePoint#inspect` have been implemented.

Compatibility:

* Improved the exception when an `-S` file isn't found.
* Removed the message from exceptions raised by bare `raise` to better match MRI (#1487).
* `TracePoint` now handles the `:class` event.

Performance:

* Source `SecureRandom.random_bytes` from `/dev/urandom` rather than OpenSSL.
* C extension bitcode is no longer encoded as Base64 to pass it to Sulong.
* Faster `String#==` using vectorization.

Changes:

* Clarified that all sources that come in from the Polyglot API `eval` method will be treated as UTF-8, and cannot be re-interpreted as another encoding using a magic comment.
* The `-Xembedded` option can now be set set on the launcher command line.
* The `-Xplatform.native=false` option can now load the core library, by enabling `-Xpolyglot.stdio`.
* `$SAFE` and `Thread#safe_level` now cannot be set to `1` - raising an error rather than warning as before. `-Xsafe` allows it to be set, but there are still no checks.
* Foreign objects are now printed as `#<Foreign:system-identity-hash-code>`, except for foreign arrays which are now printed as `#<Foreign [elements...]>`.
* Foreign objects `to_s` now calls `inspect` rather than Java's `toString`.
* The embedded configuration (`-Xembedded`) now warns about features which may not work well embedded, such as signals.
* The `-Xsync.stdio` option has been removed - use standard Ruby `STDOUT.sync = true` in your program instead.

# 1.0 RC 5, 3 August 2018

New features:

* It is no longer needed to add LLVM (`/usr/local/opt/llvm@4/bin`) to `PATH` on macOS.
* Improve error message when LLVM, `clang` or `opt` is missing.
* Automatically find LLVM and libssl with MacPorts on macOS (#1386).
* `--log.ruby.level=` can be used to set the log level from any launcher.
* Add documentation about installing with Ruby managers/installers and how to run TruffleRuby in CI such as TravisCI (#1062, #1070).
* `String#unpack1` has been implemented.

Bug fixes:

* Allow any name for constants with `rb_const_get()`/`rb_const_set()` (#1380).
* Fix `defined?` with an autoload constant to not raise but return `nil` if the autoload fails (#1377).
* Binary Ruby Strings can now only be converted to Java Strings if they only contain US-ASCII characters. Otherwise, they would produce garbled Java Strings (#1376).
* `#autoload` now correctly calls `main.require(path)` dynamically.
* Hide internal file from user-level backtraces (#1375).
* Show caller information in warnings from the core library (#1375).
* `#require` and `#require_relative` should keep symlinks in `$"` and `__FILE__` (#1383).
* Random seeds now always come directly from `/dev/urandom` for MRI compatibility.
* SIGINFO, SIGEMT and SIGPWR are now defined (#1382).
* Optional and operator assignment expressions now return the value assigned, not the value returned by an assignment method (#1391).
* `WeakRef.new` will now return the correct type of object, even if `WeakRef` is subclassed (#1391).
* Resolving constants in prepended modules failed, this has now been fixed (#1391).
* Send and `Symbol#to_proc` now take account of refinements at their call sites (#1391).
* Better warning when the timezone cannot be found on WSL (#1393).
* Allow special encoding names in `String#force_encoding` and raise an exception on bad encoding names (#1397).
* Fix `Socket.getifaddrs` which would wrongly return an empty array (#1375).
* `Binding` now remembers the file and line at which it was created for `#eval`. This is notably used by `pry`'s `binding.pry`.
* Resolve symlinks in `GEM_HOME` and `GEM_PATH` to avoid related problems (#1383).
* Refactor and fix `#autoload` so other threads see the constant defined while the autoload is in progress (#1332).
* Strings backed by `NativeRope`s now make a copy of the rope when `dup`ed.
* `String#unpack` now taints return strings if the format was tainted, and now does not taint the return array if the format was tainted.
* Lots of fixes to `Array#pack` and `String#unpack` tainting, and a better implementation of `P` and `p`.
* Array literals could evaluate an element twice under some circumstances. This has now been fixed.

Performance:

* Optimize required and optional keyword arguments.
* `rb_enc_to_index` is now faster by eliminating an expensive look-up.

Changes:

* `-Xlog=` now needs log level names to be upper case.
* `-Dtruffleruby.log` and `TRUFFLERUBY_LOG` have been removed - use `-Dpolyglot.log.ruby.level`.
* The log format, handlers, etc are now managed by the Truffle logging system.
* The custom log levels `PERFORMANCE` and `PATCH` have been removed.

# 1.0 RC 4, 18 July 2018

*TruffleRuby was not updated in RC 4*

# 1.0 RC 3, 2 July 2018

New features:

* `is_a?` can be called on foreign objects.

Bug fixes:

* It is no longer needed to have `ruby` in `$PATH` to run the post-install hook.
* `Qnil`/`Qtrue`/`Qfalse`/`Qundef` can now be used as initial value for global variables in C extensions.
* Fixed error message when the runtime libssl has no SSLv2 support (on Ubuntu 16.04 for instance).
* `RbConfig::CONFIG['extra_bindirs']` is now a String as other RbConfig values.
* `SIGPIPE` is correctly caught on SubstrateVM, and the corresponding write() raises `Errno::EPIPE` when the read end of a pipe or socket is closed.
* Use the magic encoding comment for determining the source encoding when using eval().
* Fixed a couple bugs where the encoding was not preserved correctly.

Performance:

* Faster stat()-related calls, by returning the relevant field directly and avoiding extra allocations.
* `rb_str_new()`/`rb_str_new_cstr()` are much faster by avoiding extra copying and allocations.
* `String#{sub,sub!}` are faster in the common case of an empty replacement string.
* Eliminated many unnecessary memory copy operations when reading from `IO` with a delimiter (e.g., `IO#each`), leading to overall improved `IO` reading for common use cases such as iterating through lines in a `File`.
* Use the byte[] of the given Ruby String when calling eval() directly for parsing.

# 1.0 RC 2, 6 June 2018

New features:

* We are now compatible with Ruby 2.4.4.
* `object.class` on a Java `Class` object will give you an object on which you can call instance methods, rather than static methods which is what you get by default.
* The log level can now also be set with `-Dtruffleruby.log=info` or `TRUFFLERUBY_LOG=info`.
* `-Xbacktraces.raise` will print Ruby backtraces whenever an exception is raised.
* `Java.import name` imports Java classes as top-level constants.
* Coercion of foreign numbers to Ruby numbers now works.
* `to_s` works on all foreign objects and calls the Java `toString`.
* `to_str` will try to `UNBOX` and then re-try `to_str`, in order to provoke the unboxing of foreign strings.

Changes:

* The version string now mentions if you're running GraalVM Community Edition (`GraalVM CE`) or GraalVM Enterprise Edition (`GraalVM EE`).
* The inline JavaScript functionality `-Xinline_js` has been removed.
* Line numbers `< 0`, in the various eval methods, are now warned about, because we don't support these at all. Line numbers `> 1` are warned about (at the fine level) but they are shimmed by adding blank lines in front to get to the correct offset. Line numbers starting at `0` are also warned about at the fine level and set to `1` instead.
* The `erb` standard library has been patched to stop using a -1 line number.
* `-Xbacktraces.interleave_java` now includes all the trailing Java frames.
* Objects with a `[]` method, except for `Hash`, now do not return anything for `KEYS`, to avoid the impression that you could `READ` them. `KEYINFO` also returns nothing for these objects, except for `Array` where it returns information on indices.
* `String` now returns `false` for `HAS_KEYS`.
* The supported additional functionality module has been renamed from `Truffle` to `TruffleRuby`. Anything not documented in `doc/user/truffleruby-additions.md` should not be used.
* Imprecise wrong gem directory detection was replaced. TruffleRuby newly marks its gem directories with a marker file, and warns if you try to use TruffleRuby with a gem directory which is lacking the marker.

Bug fixes:

* TruffleRuby on SubstrateVM now correctly determines the system timezone.
* `Kernel#require_relative` now coerces the feature argument to a path and canonicalizes it before requiring, and it now uses the current directory as the directory for a synthetic file name from `#instance_eval`.

# 1.0 RC 1, 17 April 2018

New features:

* The Ruby version has been updated to version 2.3.7.

Security:

* CVE-2018-6914, CVE-2018-8779, CVE-2018-8780, CVE-2018-8777, CVE-2017-17742 and CVE-2018-8778 have been mitigated.

Changes:

* `RubyTruffleError` has been removed and uses replaced with standard exceptions.
* C++ libraries like `libc++` are now not needed if you don't run C++ extensions. `libc++abi` is now never needed. Documentation updated to make it more clear what the minimum requirements for pure Ruby, C extensions, and C++ extensions separately.
* C extensions are now built by default - `TRUFFLERUBY_CEXT_ENABLED` is assumed `true` unless set to `false`.
* The `KEYS` interop message now returns an array of Java strings, rather than Ruby strings. `KEYS` on an array no longer returns indices.
* `HAS_SIZE` now only returns `true` for `Array`.
* A method call on a foreign object that looks like an operator (the method name does not begin with a letter) will call `IS_BOXED` on the object and based on that will possibly `UNBOX` and convert to Ruby.
* Now using the native version of Psych.
* The supported version of LLVM on Oracle Linux has been dropped to 3.8.
* The supported version of Fedora has been dropped to 25, and the supported version of LLVM to 3.8, due to LLVM incompatibilities. The instructions for installing `libssl` have changed to match.

# 0.33, April 2018

New features:

* The Ruby version has been updated to version 2.3.6.
* Context pre-initialization with TruffleRuby `--native`, which significantly improves startup time and loads the `did_you_mean` gem ahead of time.
* The default VM is changed to SubstrateVM, where the startup is significantly better. Use `--jvm` option for full JVM VM.
* The `Truffle::Interop` module has been replaced with a new `Polyglot` module which is designed to use more idiomatic Ruby syntax rather than explicit methods. A [new document](doc/user/polyglot.md) describes polyglot programming at a higher level.
* The `REMOVABLE`, `MODIFIABLE` and `INSERTABLE` Truffle interop key info flags have been implemented.
* `equal?` on foreign objects will check if the underlying objects are equal if both are Java interop objects.
* `delete` on foreign objects will send `REMOVE`, `size` will send `GET_SIZE`, and `keys` will send `KEYS`. `respond_to?(:size)` will send `HAS_SIZE`, `respond_to?(:keys)` will send `HAS_KEYS`.
* Added a new Java-interop API similar to the one in the Nashorn JavaScript implementation, as also implemented by Graal.js. The `Java.type` method returns a Java class object on which you can use normal interop methods. Needs the `--jvm` flag to be used.
* Supported and tested versions of LLVM for different platforms have been more precisely [documented](doc/user/installing-llvm.md).

Changes:

* Interop semantics of `INVOKE`, `READ`, `WRITE`, `KEYS` and `KEY_INFO` have changed significantly, so that `INVOKE` maps to Ruby method calls, `READ` calls `[]` or returns (bound) `Method` objects, and `WRITE` calls `[]=`.

Performance:

* `Dir.glob` is much faster and more memory efficient in cases that can reduce to direct filename lookups.
* `SecureRandom` now defers loading OpenSSL until it's needed, reducing time to load `SecureRandom`.
* `Array#dup` and `Array#shift` have been made constant-time operations by sharing the array storage and keeping a starting index.

Bug fixes:

* Interop key-info works with non-string-like names.

Internal changes:

* Changes to the lexer and translator to reduce regular expression calls.
* Some JRuby sources have been updated to 9.1.13.0.

# 0.32, March 2018

New features:

* A new embedded configuration is used when TruffleRuby is used from another language or application. This disables features like signals which may conflict with the embedding application, and threads which may conflict with other languages, and enables features such as the use of polyglot IO streams.

Performance:

* Conversion of ASCII-only Ruby strings to Java strings is now faster.
* Several operations on multi-byte character strings are now faster.
* Native I/O reads are about 22% faster.

Bug fixes:

* The launcher accepts `--native` and similar options in  the `TRUFFLERUBYOPT` environment variable.

Internal changes:

* The launcher is now part of the TruffleRuby repository, rather than part of the GraalVM repository.
* `ArrayBuilderNode` now uses `ArrayStrategies` and `ArrayMirrors` to remove direct knowledge of array storage.
* `RStringPtr` and `RStringPtrEnd` now report as pointers for interop purposes, fixing several issues with `char *` usage in C extensions.
