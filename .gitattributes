# Rules for GitHub's Linguist language-classification system. We're abusing the
# 'vendored' attribute to exclude files as a lot of this isn't really vendored,
# and a whole lot of actually vendored code isn't listed! What we want to do is
# make the stats accurate for what is actually runtime code.

# Note that changes to this file have to be *committed* for github-linguist to
# notice them.

# Non-runtime code
