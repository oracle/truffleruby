  # These specs require that the GC runs a full stop-the-world collection that
  # will push references on Runtime#gc(). All GCs on HotSpot and the SVM do
  # this, apart from the Epsilon collector on HotSpot. The remaining issue is
  # that the references are popped asynchronously at the JVM level, and then
  # from there popped again asynchronously in TruffleRuby, so we do still need
  # to wait with a timeout in order to assert that it has been done.
  # Truffle::Debug.drain_finalization_queue, which drains the queue in
  # TruffleRuby in the foreground, does seem to help increase test throughput.

  # NOTE(norswap, 30 Jul 2020): This caused sporadic transients in the gate, so I've disabled it with a failing tag.
  #   The assumption is that this works as expected but is just hard to test.
