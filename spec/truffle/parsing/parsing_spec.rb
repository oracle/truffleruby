# Test cases are stored in YAML files of the following structure:
#
#   ``` yaml
#   subject: "short description"
#   description: "long description"
#   notes: >
#     "some additional details to explain what this case actually tests (optional)"
#   focused_on_node: "a node class name" (optional)
#   main_script: true
#   index: "integer, position of a node to focus on in AST when there are several such nodes and we need not the first one (optional)"
#   ruby: |
#     <Ruby source code>
#   ast: |
#     <Truffle AST>
#   ```
#
# The following attributes might be a multiline string,
# so leading and terminating blank characters should be removed:
# - description
# - source_code
# - expected_ast
#
# index is an optional attribute. Missing it means we need a node with index 0.
#
# main_script - false by default. Means it's a loaded/required Ruby source file or the main one that is run by user.
# Some logic is related to main script, e.g. initialization of the DATA constant etc.
#
# Don't run specs in multi-context mode and with JIT because they affect AST:
# - in multi-context mode some nodes are replaced with dynamic-lexical-scope related ones
# - with JIT some nodes are replaced with optimized ones (e.g. OptimizedCallTarget)
#
# To regenerate fixture YAML files with actual AST run the following command:
#
#   OVERWRITE_PARSING_RESULTS=true jt -q test spec/truffle/parsing/parsing_spec.rb
#
# To ensure that fixtures are valid and are passing on the new translator, use:
#
#   jt -q test spec/truffle/parsing/parsing_spec.rb
#
# An approach with YAML.dump has some downsides:
# - it adds a line `---` at a file beginning
# - it removes unnecessary "" for string literals
# - it looses the folded style (with > indicator) for multiline blocks
# - it looses comments inside YAML document
# So just replace AST in a YAML file using a regexp.
