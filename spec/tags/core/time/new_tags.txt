fails:Time.new with a utc_offset argument with an argument that responds to #to_r coerces using #to_r
fails:Time.new with a utc_offset argument raises ArgumentError if the argument represents a value less than or equal to -86400 seconds
fails:Time.new with a utc_offset argument raises ArgumentError if the argument represents a value greater than or equal to 86400 seconds
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument returns a Time in the timezone
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument accepts timezone argument that must have #local_to_utc and #utc_to_local methods
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument raises TypeError if timezone does not implement #local_to_utc method
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument does not raise exception if timezone does not implement #utc_to_local method
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument the #abbr method is used by '%Z' in #strftime
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument returned value by #utc_to_local and #local_to_utc methods could be Time instance
fails:Time.new with a timezone argument returned value by #utc_to_local and #local_to_utc methods could be Time subclass instance
