This version of Berkeley Yacc was taken from the BSD-Lite CD and
targeted to Java by Axel T. Schreiner <mailto:ats@cs.rit.edu>

Makefile -> makefile	removed Berkeleyisms, call it jay

defs.h			eliminate -dlpr options, %union, output_file,
			#ident, skeleton.c references
			changed line_format to char*

error.c			eliminate %union

main.c			eliminate -dlpr options, %union, output_file
			added -c option to influence #line
			switched from mktemp() to mkstemp()

output.c		eliminate -dlpr options, %union, output_file
			fix #define, short, -t/yyDebug
			respell YYERRCODE, YYTABLESIZE, YYFINAL, YYMAXTOKEN
			output trailer last
			switch to filter behaviour

reader.c		eliminate output_file, #ident
			#line -> // line, pass //
			yyvsp[] -> yyVals[yyTop], yyval -> yyVal

skeleton.c		Java and C# skeletons

test			removed

yacc.1 -> ../jay.1	adapted

yyfix.*			removed

Types: there is a significant difference. yacc uses %union to cast
the value stack and <tag> to select alternatives. This works for
l- and r-values alike.  jay uses Object as the value stack and
<tag> to set a class. l-values must not be cast. $n should not be
assigned to, but $$ usually is. $n is referenced, but $$ usually
is not. Consequently jay casts $n and $<tag>$ but not $<>n and $$.
This makes assignment to $n references to $$ kludgily possible.
As another kludge, to prevent 'untyped' messages and to avoid
unnecessary casts, casts to "Object" are not emitted.

Conflicts: the usual type table may be used but conflict/Conflict.jay
demonstrates that a trivial %nonassoc is silently ignored.

Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2:

FILES			new directory structure under Language Processing
package.html		homepage
{cs,java}/skeleton.*	min yyErrorFlag is 0 when passed to shift()

Changes from 1.0 to 1.0.1:

java/arith/makefile	changed CLASSPATH
jay/reader.c(1094)	fixed typo -- thanks to etienne.cochard@ciel.com

Changes from 0.9 to 1.0:

Merged C# port from mcs-0.16 at <http://www.go-mono.org> by Miguel
de Icaza <mailto:miguel@ximian.com>. Changed naming conventions in the skeletons.

Changes from 0.8 to 0.9:

output.c		Tables now written as text, top-level classes gone

skeleton.java		Revamped to load tables from resource.

Changes from 0.7 to 0.8:

output.c                Each generated table is now encapsulated in a top
			level nested class to circumvent Java's 64K code
			limit (Thanks to Andre Marburger).

skeleton		Fixed to access the tables inside the classes.

yydebug/yyPrintStream	Fixed NullPointerException introduced by JDK 1.2.
