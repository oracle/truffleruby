# <!-- rdoc-file=ext/zlib/zlib.c -->
# This module provides access to the [zlib library](http://zlib.net). Zlib is
# designed to be a portable, free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that
# is, not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on
# virtually any computer hardware and operating system.
#
# The zlib compression library provides in-memory compression and decompression
# functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
#
# The zlib compressed data format is described in RFC 1950, which is a wrapper
# around a deflate stream which is described in RFC 1951.
#
# The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format with
# an interface similar to that of IO. The gzip format is described in RFC 1952
# which is also a wrapper around a deflate stream.
#
# The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory and on
# communications channels. The gzip format was designed for single-file
# compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
# directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.
#
# See your system's zlib.h for further information about zlib
#
# ## Sample usage
#
# Using the wrapper to compress strings with default parameters is quite simple:
#
#     require "zlib"
#
#     data_to_compress = File.read("don_quixote.txt")
#
#     puts "Input size: #{data_to_compress.size}"
#     #=> Input size: 2347740
#
#     data_compressed = Zlib::Deflate.deflate(data_to_compress)
#
#     puts "Compressed size: #{data_compressed.size}"
#     #=> Compressed size: 887238
#
#     uncompressed_data = Zlib::Inflate.inflate(data_compressed)
#
#     puts "Uncompressed data is: #{uncompressed_data}"
#     #=> Uncompressed data is: The Project Gutenberg EBook of Don Quixote...
