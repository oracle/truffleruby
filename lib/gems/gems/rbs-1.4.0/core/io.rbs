# The [IO](IO) class is the basis for all input and
# output in Ruby. An I/O stream may be *duplexed* (that is,
# bidirectional), and so may use more than one native operating system
# stream.
#
# Many of the examples in this section use the
# [File](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/File.html) class, the only
# standard subclass of [IO](IO). The two classes are
# closely associated. Like the
# [File](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/File.html) class, the Socket
# library subclasses from [IO](IO) (such as TCPSocket
# or UDPSocket).
#
# The
# [Kernel\#open](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Kernel.html#method-i-open)
# method can create an [IO](IO) (or
# [File](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/File.html) ) object for these
# types of arguments:
#
#   - A plain string represents a filename suitable for the underlying
#     operating system.
#
#   - A string starting with `"|"` indicates a subprocess. The remainder
#     of the string following the `"|"` is invoked as a process with
#     appropriate input/output channels connected to it.
#
#   - A string equal to `"|-"` will create another Ruby instance as a
#     subprocess.
#
# The [IO](IO) may be opened with different file modes
# (read-only, write-only) and encodings for proper conversion. See
# [::new](IO#method-c-new) for these options. See
# [Kernel\#open](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Kernel.html#method-i-open)
# for details of the various command formats described above.
#
# [::popen](IO#method-c-popen), the Open3 library, or
# Process\#spawn may also be used to communicate with subprocesses through
# an [IO](IO).
#
# Ruby will convert pathnames between different operating system
# conventions if possible. For instance, on a Windows system the filename
# `"/gumby/ruby/test.rb"` will be opened as `"\gumby\ruby\test.rb"` . When
# specifying a Windows-style filename in a Ruby string, remember to escape
# the backslashes:
#
# ```ruby
# "C:\\gumby\\ruby\\test.rb"
# ```
#
# Our examples here will use the Unix-style forward slashes;
# File::ALT\_SEPARATOR can be used to get the platform-specific separator
# character.
#
# The global constant [ARGF](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/ARGF.html)
# (also accessible as `$<` ) provides an IO-like stream which allows
# access to all files mentioned on the command line (or STDIN if no files
# are mentioned).
# [ARGF\#path](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/ARGF.html#method-i-path)
# and its alias
# [ARGF\#filename](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/ARGF.html#method-i-filename)
# are provided to access the name of the file currently being read.
#
#
# The io/console extension provides methods for interacting with the
# console. The console can be accessed from IO.console or the standard
# input/output/error [IO](IO) objects.
#
# Requiring io/console adds the following methods:
#
#   - IO::console
#
#   - IO\#raw
#
#   - IO\#raw\!
#
#   - IO\#cooked
#
#   - IO\#cooked\!
#
#   - IO\#getch
#
#   - IO\#echo=
#
#   - IO\#echo?
#
#   - IO\#noecho
#
#   - IO\#winsize
#
#   - IO\#winsize=
#
#   - IO\#iflush
#
#   - IO\#ioflush
#
#   - IO\#oflush
#
# Example:
#
# ```ruby
# require 'io/console'
# rows, columns = $stdout.winsize
# puts "Your screen is #{columns} wide and #{rows} tall"
# ```

  # this method is a no-op.
  #
  # *advice* is one of the following symbols:
  #
  # :normal
  # :   No advice to give; the default assumption for an open file.
  # :sequential
  # :   The data will be accessed sequentially with lower offsets read before
  #     higher ones.
  # :random
  # :   The data will be accessed in random order.
  # :willneed
  # :   The data will be accessed in the near future.
  # :dontneed
  # :   The data will not be accessed in the near future.
  # :noreuse
  # :   The data will only be accessed once.
  #
  #
  # The semantics of a piece of advice are platform-dependent. See *man 2
  # posix_fadvise* for details.
  #
  # "data" means the region of the current file that begins at *offset* and
  # extends for *len* bytes. If *len* is 0, the region ends at the last byte of
  # the file. By default, both *offset* and *len* are 0, meaning that the advice
  # applies to the entire file.
  #
  # If an error occurs, one of the following exceptions will be raised:
  #
  # IOError
  # :   The IO stream is closed.
  # Errno::EBADF
  # :   The file descriptor of the current file is invalid.
  # Errno::EINVAL
  # :   An invalid value for *advice* was given.
  # Errno::ESPIPE
  # :   The file descriptor of the current file refers to a FIFO or pipe. (Linux

  # TypeError
  # :   Either *advice* was not a Symbol, or one of the other arguments was not an
