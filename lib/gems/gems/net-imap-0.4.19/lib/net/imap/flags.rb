    # :section: System Flags
    #
    # A message has a list of zero or more named tokens, known as "flags",
    # associated with it. A flag is set by its addition to this list and is
    # cleared by its removal. There are two types of flags in
    # IMAP4rev1[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3501.html] and
    # IMAP4rev2[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html]: flags and
    # keywords. A flag of either type can be permanent or session-only.
    #
    # A "system flag" is a message flag name that is predefined in the \IMAP
    # specifications and begins with <tt>"\"</tt>.  Net::IMAP returns all
    # system flags as symbols, without the <tt>"\"</tt> prefix.

    # Also a mailbox special use attribute, which indicates that this mailbox
    # presents all messages marked in some way as "important".  When this

    # :section: Basic Mailbox Attributes
    # Mailbox name attributes will be returned in #list responses.  Base
    # attributes must be returned according to the server's capabilities.
    #
    # IMAP4 specifies that all mailbox name attributes, including future
    # extensions, begin with <tt>"\"</tt>.  Net::IMAP returns all mailbox
    # attributes as symbols, without the <tt>"\"</tt> prefix.
    #
    # Mailbox name attributes are not case-sensitive.  <em>The current
    # implementation</em> normalizes mailbox attribute case using
    # String#capitalize, such as +:Noselect+ (not +:NoSelect+).  The constants
    # (such as NO_SELECT) can also be used for comparison.  The constants have
    # been defined both with and without underscores between words.
    #
    # <em>The descriptions here were copied from</em> {[RFC-9051 ยง
    # 7.3.1]}[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9051.html#section-7.3.1].
    #
    # Other mailbox name attributes can be found in the {IANA IMAP Mailbox Name
    # Attributes registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/imap-mailbox-name-attributes/imap-mailbox-name-attributes.xhtml].
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ##
    # The +\NonExistent+ attribute indicates that a mailbox name does not refer
    # to an existing mailbox. Note that this attribute is not meaningful by
    # itself, as mailbox names that match the canonical #list pattern but don't
    # exist must not be returned unless one of the two conditions listed below
    # is also satisfied:
    #
    # 1. The mailbox name also satisfies the selection criteria (for example,
    #    it is subscribed and the "SUBSCRIBED" selection option has been
    #    specified).
    #
    # 2. "RECURSIVEMATCH" has been specified, and the mailbox name has at least
    #    one descendant mailbox name that does not match the #list pattern and
    #    does match the selection criteria.
    #
    # In practice, this means that the +\NonExistent+ attribute is usually
    # returned with one or more of +\Subscribed+, +\Remote+, +\HasChildren+, or
    # the CHILDINFO extended data item.
    #
    # The client must treat the presence of the +\NonExistent+ attribute as if the
    # +\NoSelect+ attribute was also sent by the server
    NONEXISTENT = :Nonexistent

    # Mailbox attribute indicating it is not possible for any child levels of
    # hierarchy to exist under this name; no child levels exist now and none can
    # be created in the future children.

    # +\HasNoChildren+ attribute was also sent by the server

    # Mailbox attribute indicating it is not possible to use this name as a
    # selectable mailbox.
    NO_SELECT = :Noselect

    # The presence of this attribute indicates that the mailbox has child
    # mailboxes. A server SHOULD NOT set this attribute if there are child
    # mailboxes and the user does not have permission to access any of them.  In
    # this case, +\HasNoChildren+ SHOULD be used. In many cases, however, a
    # server may not be able to efficiently compute whether a user has access to
    # any child mailboxes. Note that even though the +\HasChildren+ attribute
    # for a mailbox must be correct at the time of processing the mailbox, a
    # client must be prepared to deal with a situation when a mailbox is marked
    # with the +\HasChildren+ attribute, but no child mailbox appears in the
    # response to the #list command. This might happen, for example, due to child
    # mailboxes being deleted or made inaccessible to the user (using access
    # control) by another client before the server is able to list them.
    #
    # It is an error for the server to return both a +\HasChildren+ and a
    # +\HasNoChildren+ attribute in the same #list response. A client that
    # encounters a #list response with both +\HasChildren+ and +\HasNoChildren+
    # attributes present should act as if both are absent in the #list response.
    HAS_CHILDREN = :Haschildren

    # The presence of this attribute indicates that the mailbox has NO child
    # mailboxes that are accessible to the currently authenticated user.
    #
    # It is an error for the server to return both a +\HasChildren+ and a
    # +\HasNoChildren+ attribute in the same #list response. A client that
    # encounters a #list response with both +\HasChildren+ and +\HasNoChildren+
    # attributes present should act as if both are absent in the #list response.
    #
    # Note: the +\HasNoChildren+ attribute should not be confused with the
    # +\NoInferiors+ attribute, which indicates that no child mailboxes exist
    # now and none can be created in the future.
    HAS_NO_CHILDREN = :Hasnochildren

    # The mailbox has been marked "interesting" by the server; the mailbox
    # probably contains messages that have been added since the last time the
    # mailbox was selected.
    #
    # If it is not feasible for the server to determine whether or not the
    # mailbox is "interesting", the server SHOULD NOT send either +\Marked+ or

    # +\Unmarked+, and +\NoSelect+ for a single mailbox, and it MAY send none of
    # these.

    # :section: Mailbox role attributes
    #
    # Mailbox name attributes will be returned in #list responses.  In addition
    # to the base mailbox name attributes defined above, an \IMAP server MAY
    # also include any or all of the following attributes that denote "role" (or
    # "special-use") of a mailbox. These attributes are included along with base
    # attributes defined above. A given mailbox may have none, one, or more than
    # one of these attributes. In some cases, a special use is advice to a
    # client about what to put in that mailbox. In other cases, it's advice to a
    # client about what to expect to find there.
    #
    # IMAP4 specifies that all mailbox name attributes, including future
    # extensions, begin with <tt>"\"</tt>.  Net::IMAP returns all mailbox
    # attributes as symbols, without the <tt>"\"</tt> prefix.
    #
    # The special use attributes were first defined as part of the

    ARCHIVE = :Archive

    # Mailbox attribute indicating that this mailbox is used to hold draft

    # implementations, this might be a virtual mailbox, containing messages from
    # other mailboxes that are marked with the +\Deleted+ message flag.
    # Alternatively, this might just be advice that a client that chooses not to
    # use the \IMAP +\Deleted+ model should use as its trash location. In server
    # implementations that strictly expect the \IMAP +\Deleted+ model, this
    # special use is likely not to be supported.
