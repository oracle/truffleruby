# Reporting polymorphism for SingletonClassNode would cause a lot of splitting, and for most usages,
# getting the singleton class is a slow-path operation (e.g., to define class methods).
# Having an uncached version of SingletonClassNode might help for this.
# Always splitting Kernel#singleton_class would be an option, but it doesn't seem worth the cost.
